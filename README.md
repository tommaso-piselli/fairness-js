# Fairness JS

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Machine Learning + Visualization model built to study fair visualization of graphs. Inspired by recent papers published in the Machine Learning area, we try to present a novel approach to Fairness (i.e. absence of bias, prejudice) in the context of graph visualization. In fact, while substantially all graph drawing algorithms optimize global metrics of the computed layout and can easily incorporate local constraints (i.e.,at vertex or edge level), few algorithms can deal with more general constraints at subgroup level. In contrast, a fair visualization should guarantee that no subgroup is favored in terms of readability, that is, the possible visual complexity of the representation is equally charged among the two sets, which becomes particularly challenging in the case the cardinalities of the two sets are unbalanced. \\
